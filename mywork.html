            <h3>Copy, Copy</h3>
            <p>
                David Tune of Boambee, NSW, was reminded of a particularly clever pair of IT Diploma
                students who handed in a joint research assignment, complete with the required signed
                statement that it was all their original work.
            </p>
            <p>
                Tune recalls: Upon reading the work for grading, I was incredibly impressed to find
                three pages of the document written in perfect technical German, particularly given
                that the students in question were none too articulate when I asked 'Sprechen sie Deutsch?'

            <h3>End result</h3>
            <p>
                Assignment rejected, students counselled and more care taken when cutting
                and pasting to cover assignment work.

            <h3>BUT IT LECTURERS ARE A FUNNY LOT</h3>
            <p>
                Jun Li, a programmer, recalls working in IT support at a school.

                "I was told to set up a projector in one of the meeting rooms for school staff,
                as there was a presentation. Having done that, I hooked the presentation laptop
                to the network and tried to help one of the speakers from the IT faculty update
                the laptop to IE7. I logged off and asked her to log on with her account to try
                IE7.
            </p>
            <p>
                'What is that?' she asked when the IE7 install process asked whether phishing
                should be turned on. After I explained it, she told me that she was about to
                present a talk on internet security."

            <h3>TUTORING THE TUTOR</h3>

                Someone from IT got out the disc the next day when they upended the machine
                and it fell out. Then, a week later, after I gave the lecturer her CD back,
                she was back within five minutes, saying, 'You won't believe it, I've done it again!'

                And this was their computing tutor? So there I am in front of her class,
                shaking the heck out of the machine. So much for teaching people to handle
                their computers with care!"

                Ian Caldewell, a self-styled 'PC tinkerer', refurbishes PCs, and has ways of
                acquiring modems, monitors, CPUs, boxes and RAM - to the point where it has
                become a pastime consuming most of his leisure time. He now has streams of
                people seeking repairs, advice and assistance.

                "Recently, I replaced an old power supply for a couple, and, when they came
                to collect, they asked whether I made house calls.

                I said I could and asked what they needed."

                The lady told Caldewell she'd bought a new wireless mouse, and, since it
                was the last one on display, it didn't come with a box or instructions.

                "I asked her: 'Did you put batteries in it?!'

                She hadn't, of course."

            <h3>MAKE MY DAY, PC</h3>
            <p>
                Chris Aitken, a designer and programmer from Camden, NSW, believes his story
                proves that tech support is one of the most stressful jobs on earth. He recalls
                working for a small internet provider in the late '90s, when one of the customers
                was a local police officer.

                Fix a computer by intimidating it.
            </h3>
            <p>
                "He was also an expert in crashing Windows 98. On one occasion, he brought his
                tower into the office, sat it on the counter, pulled his service pistol out of
                his holster and pointed it straight at the tower, threatening to shoot it.

                Another time he put his (by now very nervous) PC tower onto the counter, again
                took out his pistol, held it by the barrel and started banging the butt of the
                gun onto the top of the computer, quite hard too.

                It's no wonder techies go grey - or bald - early!"

                This is the first we've heard of someone trying to fix a computer by intimidating it.
